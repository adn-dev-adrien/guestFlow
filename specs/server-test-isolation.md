## 1. Context

The audit of 2026-10-28 found three server tests (`airbnb-no-checkout-chores`, `reservations-commission`,
`hourly-resources/sas-preview-hook`) that load `models/reservationsModel` → `database.js` without setting
`DB_PATH`. `database.js` then creates and migrates `server/guestflow.db` — in a developer's main checkout
that file is often a copy of production, so running a branch's suite applied that branch's migrations to it.

## 2. Goal

Running `npm test` can never create, open or migrate the checkout's own `server/guestflow.db`.

## 3. Functional rules

1. **Every test process gets its own database.** `npm test` preloads `src/tests/setup/isolateDefaultDb.js`
   (`node --require`) into each test process: it sets `DB_PATH` to a fresh file in the OS temp directory and
   clears `PERSISTENT_DB`. A test that needs its own location still sets `DB_PATH` itself, as before.
2. **Opening the default path fails loudly.** The same preload wraps `better-sqlite3`: opening
   `server/guestflow.db` (or its `-wal` / `-shm`) throws « A test opened the checkout's own database », so a
   test that bypasses rule 1 fails instead of silently migrating a real file. `:memory:` is untouched.
3. **The three offenders set their own temporary database** at the top of the file, so they are safe when run
   alone (`node --test <file>`), without the preload.

4. **Rules 1-2 hold without the preload too** (added 2026-10-29). `database.js` and `utils/instancePaths.js` call
   `utils/testProcessIsolation.js`: under the test runner (`NODE_TEST_CONTEXT`, set in every `node --test` child),
   a process that names no `DB_PATH` / `PERSISTENT_DB`, `GUESTFLOW_LOCAL_ENV` or `GUESTFLOW_UPLOADS_DIR` gets
   them in a private temp directory (`<tmp>/data/guestflow.db`, `env.local`, `uploads/`), removed at exit.
   The preload uses the same module (forced), so the deploy root resolved from `DB_PATH` is the private
   directory and not the shared `$TMPDIR`, and `server/.env.local` is never written by a suite. The process's
   `TMPDIR` also moves to `<tmp>/tmp`, so the scratch directories suites create with `os.tmpdir()` (≈500 per
   full run before: `gf-phase4-*`, `gf-website-booking-*`, `gvr-*`…) are removed with the process.

**Edge cases:**
- A targeted `node --test <file>` used to open and migrate `server/guestflow.db` for 389 test files (audit R2,
  2026-10-29); rule 4 closes that. Rule 3 stays as the explicit guard of the three first offenders.
- Only a process outside the test runner (e.g. `node -e`) opens the default path. `node --test --experimental-test-isolation=none`
  runs the files in the parent process, where `NODE_TEST_CONTEXT` is not set: that mode is isolated only with the
  preload (`npm test` never uses it). A process with `NODE_ENV=production` is never isolated, even under the runner.

## 4. Architecture

### 4.1 Server side (`server/src/`)

| Layer | File | T/C | Responsibility in this change |
|---|---|---|---|
| `tests/setup/` | `isolateDefaultDb.js` | C | Preload: temp `DB_PATH` / `.env.local` / uploads per process + guard on the default path. |
| `utils/` | `testProcessIsolation.js` | T | Rule 4: same isolation for a process run without the preload. |
| `database.js`, `utils/instancePaths.js` | | T | Call it before reading the environment. |
| `tests/` | `server-test-isolation.unit.test.js` | C | Pins rules 1-2 in a child process. |
| `tests/`, `plugins/hourly-resources/tests/` | the three offenders | T | Rule 3. |
| `package.json` | `test` script | T | `--require ./src/tests/setup/isolateDefaultDb.js`. |

### 4.2 Client side

None. API, data model and UI are unchanged.

## 7. Test plan

- [x] `server-test-isolation.unit.test.js`: the preload sets a temp `DB_PATH` (rule 1), refuses the default path and its `-wal` / `-shm` (rule 2), allows `:memory:` and the temp file.
- [x] Rule 4: a single file run (`settings-model`) without preload leaves `guestflow.db` / `.env.local` / `uploads` untouched; under `NODE_TEST_CONTEXT` the three defaults are in the temp dir.
- [x] Rule 3: the three tests, run alone with `server/guestflow.db` removed, leave no file behind.

## 8. Out of scope

- E2E runs write `server/.env.local` through `instancePaths`; that is a separate, by-design path.
